## Objective

After taking this course, students should be able to write small to
medium-scale Python projects that help them in their daily research.

We shall be using Python 3. The course will cover the basics of the
Python programming language, followed by guiding the students to
develop their own Python application to do web scraping and simple
data analysis.

## Structure

This is intended to be a 8-week course introducing the basics of
Python, with hands-on practical experience for upto 20 students.

Each week will have 2 hour sessions, with 1 hour of lectures and 1 hour of
practicals. Students are required to bring their own laptop. Guidance will
be provided in the first week to set up their computing environment (e.g.
installing Python software).

## Text

The primary reference text for
the course will be the book 
[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
by Al Sweigart. In addition, the course materials will include lecture
slides and handouts.
